# Fire Detection
Digital Image Processing application on fire detection.

## Abstract
Man mastered the use of fire millions of years ago. But throughout human history, fire has been closely associated with disaster. To this day, fire takes away tens of thousands of lives from this planet every year. Not to mention the forest fires and other damage to both nature and the economy. People have long been seeking for ways to detect fire and alarm in advance. In addition to some devices based on related geometric principles or light energy, image and video processing technologies are the new trends. This task mainly discussed two traditional methods based on different principles for fire detection to deal with separate conditions.
